Opening Scene,"You are boy named Milo and you live in a city and go to middle school.<br><br> You tend to not know what to do with yourself -- not just sometimes, but always. It's a big problem for you. TEST","First Time,Second Life,Mastermind",
Meet Milo,"When you are in school you long to be out, and when you are out you long to be in. On the way you think about coming home, and coming home you think about going. Wherever you are you wish you were somewhere else, and when you get there you wonder why you bothered. Nothing really interests you—least of all the things that should.<br><br>""It seems to me that almost everything is a waste of time,"" you say out loud one day as you walk dejectedly home from school. ""I can't see the point in learning to solve useless problems, or subtracting turnips from turnips, or knowing where Ethiopia is or how to spell February.""<br><br>And, since no one ever bothered to explain otherwise, you regard the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all.","Sigh,Pick Nose",First Time
Go On,"As you and your unhappy thoughts hurry along (for while you are never anxious to be where you are going, you like to get there as quickly as possible) it seems a great wonder that the world, which was so large, could sometimes feel so small and empty.<br><br>""And worst of all,"" you continue to say out loud, ""there's nothing for me to do, nowhere I'd care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing.""<br><br>You punctuate this last thought with such a deep sigh that a house sparrow singing nearby stops and rushes home to be with his family.<br><br>Without stopping or looking up, you rush past the buildings and busy shops that line the street and in a few minutes reach home—dash through the lobby—hop onto the elevator—two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and off again—open the apartment door—rush into your room—flop dejectedly into a chair, and grumble softly, ""Another long afternoon.""",Sigh Again,Sigh
Discover Tollbooth,"You look glumly at all the things you own.  The books that are too much trouble to read, the tools you never learned to use, and the other games and toys and  bits and pieces scattered around you. The ATV you haven't taken out all year.<br><br>And then, to one side of the room, just next to your computer, you notice something you have certainly never seen before!<br><br>Who could POSSIBLY have left such an enormous package and such a strange one? For, while it is not quite square, it is definitely not round, and for its size it is larger than almost any other big package of smaller dimension that you've ever seen!<br><br>Attached to one side is a bright-blue envelope which says simply: <br><br>""FOR MILO, WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME.""","Unpack It,Sleep On It,Tell Mom","Second Life,Sigh Again"
Wild Nightmares,"You have horrible nightmares about what happens to people when they don’t make choices.  You find yourself in a corner, covered with dust and cobwebs, as your brain rots away.  You wake up in a cold sweat.  And there is that big box, in the same place it was before.  What do you do?","Unpack It,Tell Mom","Sleep On It,Sleep On it,Pick Nose"
Mom Can't See It,You tell mom and she comes to your room with you.  You point at the box.  She says she can’t see it.  You are very angry and frustrated and yell at her.  She sends you to bed and tells you to come out again when you are reasonable. What do you do now?,"Unpack It,Sleep On it","Tell Mom,Tell Mom"
Unpack Tollbooth,"On top of the enclosing styrofoam, you find a folded paper that says ""READ ME FIRST!"" You open it, and read the following list of contents: <br><br>""One (1) genuine turnpike tollbooth to be erected according to directions.""<br><br>""Assorted coins for use in paying tolls.""<br><br>""One (1) map, up to date and carefully drawn by master cartographers, depicting natural and man-made features.""<br><br>""One (1) book of rules and traffic regulations, which may not be bent or broken.""<br><br>And in smaller letters at the bottom it concludes: ""Results are not guaranteed, but if not perfectly satisfied, your wasted time will be refunded.""","Assemble It,Check for Return Address,Call the Bomb Squad","Unpack It,Unpack It,Unpack It"
